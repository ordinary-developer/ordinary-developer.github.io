  <div class="article_text" id="post">
    <p>Here I want to list some books devoted to the concurrency theme in C++. Though the C++11 standard introduced a new functionality for concurrency (threads etc.) there only a few books devoted to this theme.</p>
<p>Here I list only the major books for this theme.</p>
<h3>The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference by by Nicolai M. Josuttis (2nd edition)</h3>
<p><img alt="The C++ Standard Library" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/5108SrrM%2BqL._SX406_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"></p>
<p>This book contains a chapter devoted to concurrency. This chapter can be regarded as an introductory material for concurrency in C++.</p>
<h3>Professional C++ by Marc Gregoire (all four editions)</h3>
<p><img alt="Professional C++" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jYNSq-RpL._SX399_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"></p>
<p>These books (all four) contains some material about concurrency. May be it is better to read the 4-th edition due to the latest (by this moment) information.</p>
<h3>Modern C++ Programming Cookbook: Recipes to explore data structure, multithreading, and networking in C++17 by Marius Bancila</h3>
<p><img alt="Modern C++ Programming Cookbook" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Juh4I0B4L._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg">
This book contains some practical issues and recipes about concurrency in C++. Examples are mostly self-evident, but this book also provides a good explanation of concurrency themes.</p>
<h3>Concurrency with Modern C++ by Rainer Grimm</h3>
<p><img alt="Concurrency with Modern C++" src="https://d2sofvawe08yqg.cloudfront.net/concurrencywithmodernc/hero?1549496655">
Also a good book about concurrency (Frankly, I haven't read it yet, but it seem trustworthy).</p>
<p>And meet the leader of the chart!</p>
<h3>C++ Concurrency in Action by Anthony Williams (2nd edition)</h3>
<p><img alt="C++ Concurrency in Action" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41tK7Fd3CBL._SX397_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg"></p>
<p>There is also the first edition, but I think it is better to read the 2-nd one because it contains additional material about the C++17 standard.</p>
<p>Amazon writes about Anthony:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anthony Williams is a UK-based developer and consultant with many years experience in C++. He has been an active member of the BSI C++ Standards Panel since 2001, and is author or coauthor of many of the C++ Standards Committee papers that led up to the inclusion of the thread library in the new C++ Standard, known as C++11 or C++0x. He has been the maintainer of the Boost Thread library since 2006, and is the developer of the just::thread implementation of the C++11 thread library from Just Software Solutions Ltd. Anthony lives in the far west of Cornwall, England.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This book is not easy but it is the most comprehensive book about this theme now, so it necessarily must be read.</p>
<p>Maybe this list is not full, but the main books are listed here. Maybe sometimes another article about new C++ concurrency books will be posted... When new books are published.</p>

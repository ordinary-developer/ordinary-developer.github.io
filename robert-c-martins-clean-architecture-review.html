  <div align="center"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41BjtnvIUQL._SX382_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg" alt="clean-architecture" /></div>
  <p align="center"><i>* This picture is a link to Amazon's picture.</i></p>
  <p align="justify">Unfortunately, my English is still not perfect (after all I am not a native speaker), but it is necessary to write longer texts. So I'll try. Dear readers, (if such will be), please correct me (grammar, orthography, punctuation etc.) in comments.</p>
  <p align="justify">The new book "Clean architecture" by famous "Uncle Bob" was released in 2017. I think it is worth reading. Next, I'll try to explain why.</p>
  <p align="justify">This book may be considered as a resume of all "Uncle Bob"'s technical life. This book has many references to his previous books. As usually "Uncle Bob"'s books may suffer from some extent of dogmatism, but it doesn't mean that it is not necessary to read them.</p>
  <p align="justify">This book contains six parts and an appendix. And I'll try to describe them shortly.</p>
  <p align="justify">The first part consisting of 2 chapters contains introductory material about an architecture and design.</p>
  <p align="justify">The second part consisting of four chapters describes the most popular programming paradigms (structured programming, object-oriented programming, and functional programming). These chapters are very brief but they are worth reading. Here Robert C. Martin tells a lot about his career and cases in his career and it is interesting, at least for me.</p>
  <p align="justify">The third part consisting of five chapters describes the S.O.L.I.D design principles. The chapters of this part can be considered as a resume of all previous S.O.L.I.D descriptions in Robert C. Martin's books.</p>
  <p align="justify">The fourth part consisting of three chapters describe component principles (REP - The Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle, CCP - The Common Closure Principle, CRP - The Common Reuse Principle, ACP - acyclic dependencies principle, SDP - the stable dependencies principle, and SAP - the stable abstractions principle). These principles are an elaboration of the S.O.L.I.D. principles applied to components. I have not seen these notions in other books. These notions of cause can be considered as slightly dogmatic (as all Robert C. Martin's books), but reading these chapters may be useful, at least for a common professional erudition.</p>
  <p align="justify">The fifth part consisting of fifteen chapters contains detailed descriptions and possible use cases of these principles.</p>
  <p align="justify">The sixth part consisting of five chapters contains some base thoughts about a harm of premature database orientation, framework orientation, web orientation. These thoughts may be helpful (for example if you want to change your DB provider or your framework).</p>
  <p align="justify">The last (seventh) part has a historical excursion to computer hardware and software evolution, their influence on the author and the authors's career path.</p>
  <p align="justify">This book is not tied to a concrete programming language and concrete runtime. It is just about software development in whole. Many people say that Robert C. Martin's style is more or less dogmatic, but nevertheless, this book may endow your mind with many useful thoughts and ideas.</p>
  <p align="justify">P.S. This post was typed with help of grammar checkers and it is not so perfect as I want it to be. So any language improvements in comments are welcome.</p>

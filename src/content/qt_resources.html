  <h1>Qt resources</h1>

  <p align="justify">It is said that a default GUI framework for C++ is Qt (Of course there are other GUI frameworks such as Gtk, wxWidgets etc., but Qt is a mainstream).</p>
  <p align="justify">So to be a competitive c++ developer it is necessary to know the Qt framework.</p>
  <p align="justify">Here some books devoted to the Qt framework are listed:</p>
  
  <h3><a href="https://qt-book.com/">Qt 5.10 Professional Programming with C++ by Max Schlee</a></h3>
  <p align="justify">This book is available only in Russian. But it is a good introductory book.
There are many other books but this one is, in my opinion, the most suitable for learning Qt from scratch</p>
  
  <h3>Other resources</h3>
  <p align="justify">Official <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/Books">qt docs</a> contain an index of Qt books (in different languages) and can be very useful for further learning.</p>

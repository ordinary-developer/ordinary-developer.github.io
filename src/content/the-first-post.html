            Here I shall post some notes about software development
            in whole and about programming (C++, Python, etc.) in
            particular. My English is not so perfect, so my posts
            will not be long. Hope, sooner or later my English will
            be improved and my posts will become longer and more
            interesting.

            And meanwhile this blog will be just a set of usefull
            references.

            write about them in commentaries.

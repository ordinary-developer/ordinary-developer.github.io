  <h1>C programming language as a lingua franca</h1>

  <p align="justify">Periodically I ask myself: &quot;What programming language is the most suitable for computer science studying?&quot;</p>
  <p align="justify">Now I think that it is ... the C programming language (yes, C).</p>
  <p align="justify">It is procedural, so can be used for implementing non-parallel algorithms from CS courses. It is concise and rather simple, so students can concentrate on algorithm understanding instead of struggles with a programming language.</p>
  <p align="justify">Widely known Joel Spolsky wrote <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/01/02/advice-for-computer-science-college-students/">something</a> about that.</p>
  <blockquote align="justify">Although C is becoming increasingly rare, it is
  still the lingua franca of working programmers. It is the language they use to
  communicate with one another, and, more importantly, it is much closer to the
  machine than &qout;modern languages&qout; that you'll be taught in college like ML, Java, Python,</blockquote>
  <p align="justify">And his another thought (may be more radical):</p>
  <blockquote align="justify">"I don't care how much you know about
  continuations and closures and exception handling: if you can't explain why
  while (*s++ = *t++); copies a string, or if that isn't the most natural thing
  in the world to you, well, you're programming based on superstition, as far as
  I'm concerned: a medical doctor who doesn't know basic anatomy, passing out prescriptions based on what the pharma sales babe said would work."</blockquote>

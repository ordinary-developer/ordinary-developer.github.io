  <h1>About English grammar</h1>
  
  <p align="justify">This small post must be considered more as a reflection than a finished thought.</p>

  <p align="justify">Once I met the next phrase in the "Learning Python" (5th edition book) by Mark Lutz: "this makes for less cluttered error messages in applications that convert between exception types while processing exception chains."</p>
  
  <p align="justify">Here "exception types" means types of exceptions (a plural form).</p>

  <p align="justify">English grammar allows the next constructions:
    <ul>
      <li>types of exception  - exception types;</li>
      <li>types of exceptions - exception types.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p align="justify">So we must understand from the context (As it is often happening in the English language).</p>

  <p align="justify">And for example, I want to name a method "get_exception_type_names". What does it return? Names of a single type of a single exception? Names of types of exceptions? Or something else?</p>

  <p align="justify"><i>And again...</i><p>

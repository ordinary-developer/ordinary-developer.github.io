  <h1>About MFC learning</h1>

  <p align="justify">Despite now Microsoft MFC is an obsolete technology there are many legacy projects that use it. And this post contains some materials for learning MFC.</p>

  <h2>Books</h2>

  <h3>Programming Windows with MFC (2-nd ed.) by Jeff Prosise</h3>
  <p align="justify">It is a good introductory book about MFC. It contains many examples and most importantly first examples are written from scratch to show the all internal cookery of MFC.</p>

  <h3>MFC Programming from the Ground Up by Herbert Schildt</h3>
  <p align="justify">It is also a good introductory book about MFC.</p>

  <h3>Programming Microsoft Visual C++ (5-th ed.) by David J.Kruglinski et al.</h3>
  <p align="justify">It is a more comprehensive book but it assumes that a reader has no MFC knowledge. So, in theory, it also can be recommended for beginners.</p>

  <h3>MFC Programming with Visual C++ 6 Unleashed by David White et al.</h3>
  <p align="justify">It is also a comprehensive book and also assumes that a reader has no MFC knowledge.</p>

  <p align="justify">The two first books may be regarded as an absolute minimum for MFC and the other two books can be regarded as additional materials.</p>

  <h2>Development Environment</h2>
  <p align="justify">And now about a development environment for MFC.</p>
  <p align="justify">Of course, modern versions of Microsoft Visual Studio support creating MFC applications, but these versions are bulky and heavy. It is better to use a virtual machine with Windows XP and Microsoft Visual Studio 2003 for learning MFC. But it is of course only my opinion.</p>

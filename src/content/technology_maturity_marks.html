  <h1>Technology maturity marks</h1>

  <p align="justify">Sometimes I want to understand which technology is mature and can be used in production and which one is not. I defined several maturity marks for myself.</p>
  <p align="justify">
    <ul>
      <li>Thoughtworks radar (https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)<br />
If the technology ("technique", "tools", "Platforms", "language and frameworks") is in the "Adopt" section, then it is mature.</li>
      <li>- JetBrains ide list (https://www.jetbrains.com/)
If JetBrains has an IDE for the language, then the language is mature and can be popular on "the market".</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  
  <p align="justify">And yet another "tricky trick".</p>
  <p align="justify">If language (environment etc.) version you use is less than one from the current stable Debian Linux distributive, it can be said, that is is obsolete.</p>

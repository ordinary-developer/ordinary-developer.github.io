Summary: C++ concurrency books


Here I want to list some books devoted to the concurrency theme in C++. Though the C++11 standard introduced a new functionality for concurrency (threads etc.) there only a few books devoted to this theme.

Here I list only the major books for this theme.

### The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference by by Nicolai M. Josuttis (2nd edition)

This book contains a chapter devoted to concurrency. This chapter can be regarded as an introductory material for concurrency in C++.


### Professional C++ by Marc Gregoire (all four editions)
![Professional C++](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41jYNSq-RpL._SX399_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

These books (all four) contains some material about concurrency. May be it is better to read the 4-th edition due to the latest (by this moment) information.


### Modern C++ Programming Cookbook: Recipes to explore data structure, multithreading, and networking in C++17 by Marius Bancila
![Modern C++ Programming Cookbook](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Juh4I0B4L._SX404_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)
This book contains some practical issues and recipes about concurrency in C++. Examples are mostly self-evident, but this book also provides a good explanation of concurrency themes.


### Concurrency with Modern C++ by Rainer Grimm

Also a good book about concurrency (Frankly, I haven't read it yet, but it seem trustworthy).


And meet the leader of the chart!
### C++ Concurrency in Action by Anthony Williams (2nd edition)
![C++ Concurrency in Action](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41tK7Fd3CBL._SX397_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

There is also the first edition, but I think it is better to read the 2-nd one because it contains additional material about the C++17 standard.

Amazon writes about Anthony:
> Anthony Williams is a UK-based developer and consultant with many years experience in C++. He has been an active member of the BSI C++ Standards Panel since 2001, and is author or coauthor of many of the C++ Standards Committee papers that led up to the inclusion of the thread library in the new C++ Standard, known as C++11 or C++0x. He has been the maintainer of the Boost Thread library since 2006, and is the developer of the just::thread implementation of the C++11 thread library from Just Software Solutions Ltd. Anthony lives in the far west of Cornwall, England.

This book is not easy but it is the most comprehensive book about this theme now, so it necessarily must be read.

Maybe this list is not full, but the main books are listed here. Maybe sometimes another article about new C++ concurrency books will be posted... When new books are published.
